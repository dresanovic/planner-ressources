# Specification Quality Checklist: Planner-Controlled Schedule Regeneration Decision

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation iteration 1 completed on 2026-08-12: all 16 checklist items pass.
- No clarification markers remain. The confirmed FS-023 decisions and the
  established I-003 unified-generation terminology provide sufficient detail
  for planning.
- The specification is intentionally limited to the post-generation comparison
  and atomic planner decision. Candidate transport, provisional storage, and
  persistence mechanisms remain implementation-planning decisions.
